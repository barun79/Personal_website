            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I am <strong>Barun Singh</strong> -
                a curious and action-oriented developer who loves solving problems and building meaningful things.
                I believe learning is most powerful when it is hands-on, which is why I spend time coding projects,
                exploring data structures, woring on real-world apps. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passinonate about AI, deep learning, web development, and clean code. Whether it's building a 
                feature-rich planner or understanding how file systems works, I always aim to start small and improve through continuos
                learning. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of code, I reflect deeply on growth, gratitude, becoming a better human - as a son, a friend, and a future leader.
                My goal is to turn curiosity into  action and challenges into meaningful progress.
            </p>
